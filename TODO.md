# TODO

## client library

## endpoint for a client to query to see if it should check again or not (+1)

## clean up abandoned incidents (an incident in the db with no running thread) (+1)

## better mechanisms for filtering out certain metrics (done, untested)

## You should be able to open multiple incidents for one alert, so long as you have unique comment strings (similar to clustering)

## think more about clustering (similar to multiple incidents for same alert)

## some concept of incident history (meh)

## think more about flap detection (requires history)
